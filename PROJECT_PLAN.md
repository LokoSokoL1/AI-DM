\# Dungeon Manager Project Plan



\## Current Milestone - Tool Execution



Status: Implemented and deterministically tested.



Scope:



\- Accept an already validated typed `ToolCall`

\- Resolve and execute one tool through the central `ToolRegistry`

\- Return typed success, unknown-tool, invalid-argument, or tool-failure results

\- Preserve normal tool output for later use as an observation

\- Avoid retries, AI-provider calls, and direct storage access



Next milestone: ToolAgent Parser/Executor Integration. Connect provider responses
to parsing and one controlled execution/observation flow. `ToolAgent` integration
and the complete agent loop remain planned and have not started.
