\# Dungeon Manager Project Plan



\## Current Milestone - Single-Tool Observation/Response Loop



Status: Implemented and deterministically tested.



Scope:



\- Preserve one-request behavior for ordinary and malformed provider responses

\- Execute one valid parsed tool call exactly once through the existing executor

\- Send one deterministic structured execution observation to the provider

\- Preserve the raw initial response, parsed call, unchanged execution result,
and final provider response in a typed result

\- Handle post-execution serialization and provider failures without retries or
re-execution
