\# Dungeon Manager Project Plan



\## Current Milestone - Tool Schema and Prompt Contract



Status: Implemented and deterministically tested.



Scope:



\- Define immutable provider-neutral specifications for every registered tool

\- Keep character tool names, descriptions, argument schemas, and examples close
to their implementation

\- Reject malformed, duplicate, or callable-inconsistent registrations

\- Build the initial model prompt from a deterministic JSON tool catalog

\- Preserve the parser, executor, observation loop, storage defaults, and call
limits



Next milestone: **Local Ollama End-to-End Tool-Loop Validation**. It has not
started.
